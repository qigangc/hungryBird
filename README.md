# hungryBird
An hackthon Team project. 

# Project Description:
We made a web platform about food! Users can choose food online from a restaurant, after placing his/her orders, the order will be shown on merchant's side, and users can also see how the delivery goes on the map which is simulated by a circle here. After merchant confirm to deliver the order, the carrier or driver will be able to see the destination, and see the directions from a map.
Our goal of this platform is to make ordering food faster and more efficient. We thought a combination of Yelp and Uber could be a great solution of the missing of E-commerce on catering industry, and therefore we made a extreme simple one as our basis. Our long term aim is to make the platform smarter based on the accumulation of data. For example, we can give users food suggestions in order to get healthy or saving money; or we can make the distribution for the carriers more efficient by analyzing the route which will be recorded into database.
